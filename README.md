### Important!
The framework is currently under heavy development. The initial reason of its creation was to gain knowledge and understanding of the modern coding proposals of PHP. I strongly believed that the best way to do that was to create my very own framework. I would like to personally thank all those amazing developers whose code is a true inspiration for me. 

***Univeros has no intention to compete with other frameworks.***

I have read|studied|transform|modify|used code from what I believed were amazing implementations and also created my very own for those I envision should work differently. 

This framework contains the tools of an application architecture named "univeros/univeros". It will have all the **backend** required tools for the architecture to work. 

Nothing is yet published on composer, API is being defined as it goes and if you use any of its components, expect bugs until its total completion on those not yet tested. Until then, feel free to use the code within this repository. do whatever you wish with it and let me know where you use it, would be nice to see how you envisioned what was developed.
