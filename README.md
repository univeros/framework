### Important: 
The framework is currently under heavy development. The initial reason of its creation was to gain knowledge and understanding of the modern coding proposals of PHP. I strongly believed that the best way to do that was to create my very own framework. I would like to personally thank all those amazing developers whose code is a true inspiration for me. 

Univeros has no intention to compete with anybody even though everybody will be welcomed to make use of it. 

Nothing is yet published on composer, expect many bugs until completion even though I am going to create extensive tests along the way. Until then, feel free to use the code within this repository at your very own risk and if you wish to comment or collaborate, do not hesitate to contact me: learning is an amazing experience and is always better not to walk alone.
